  <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">Visual Studio Code</h2>
  <p>For developing my Digifab website, I used a software called Visual Studio Code. The reason for using this instead of any other software
    like brackets was because I am more familiar with VSC.

  <p>Learning html code was really difficult as it was my first time coding a language like this. Especially with things like needing
    to create a .css file to help with formatting and making the website look overall nicer. But, with websites like 
    <a href="w3schools.com">W3Schools</a> to teach me in coding html, it was enjoyable to learn it.
  </p>
  <p>I will not be writing everything I have done for my website but I will document the main parts of my website.</p>
  <h2>Creating a Side Navigation Bar</h2>
  <span><img src="./images/sidebarcss.jpg" width="500" height="800"><img src="./images/sidebar.jpg" width="600" height="500"></span>
  <p>Creating the side bar was definitely one of the hardest parts of making my website. I first had to fix its position on the
    website so that it moves when scrolling through the website. Since it features a dropdown as well, I also needed to create a style for
    it to make it look nice and workable.
  </p>
  <h2>Formatting</h2>
  <span><img src="./images/maincss.jpg" width="500" height="300"><img src="./images/header.jpg" width="600" height="300"></span>
  <p>This is the main css for the formatting of my website right now. I used margin-left to move the text to the left so that it would not
    collide into my sidebar and also made a header for my website for decoration purposes.
  </p>

    var dropdownContent = this.nextElementSibling;
    if (dropdownContent.style.display === "block") {
    dropdownContent.style.display = "none";
    } else {
    dropdownContent.style.display = "block";
